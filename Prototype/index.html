<!-- NOTE: Phaser library must be loaded prior to any game logic.
We load script files here to avoid windows.onload call.
Window.onload is rarely used for many reasons, and because
Phaser doesn't wait until all resources are loaded.
The DOMContentLoaded event triggers when the page is ready.
Phaser waits for the full HTML and scripts and then starts.
This is explained in greater detail in Amazon edition of
"Phaser.JS Design Guide workbook".
Last officially supported Phaser v2 release was 2.6.2
Current Community Edition (CE v2 only) is v2.10.1 (20180218)
Phaser v3 scheduled release is 201801xx
